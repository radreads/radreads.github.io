<P>The hard work is done. You’ve tendered your resignation without burning bridges. You’re at peace with the sunk cost of putting a successful career trajectory on hold. You’ve modeled out your cash flows. Your health insurance is buttoned up. After all, quitting should be easier for executives – with savings come safety nets. Yet, once they quit they look more like deer in headlights than wolves of Wall Street. I should know, three years ago I was one of them. </P>

<P>I’m intentionally using “execs” quite liberally. One would qualify if a) you have savings for some kind of break and b) parts of your identity are tied to your industry or skill set. And even if the corner office feels like it’s miles away, do not despair; starting a contemplation practice, the power of life coaching, and loss-of-identity-induced FOMO are relevant at any stage of a career. </P>

  <H1>But first, a warning</H1>
<P>You’ve presumably read Sapiens and are hip to the fact that humans crave stories. In the book, Yuval Harari argues that it’s stories that separate us from the rest of the animal kingdom. Examples of these “stories” include religion, currency, law, and political ideologies. These “stories” enable mass coordination across mankind, resulting in our spectacular leap as a species.</P>
